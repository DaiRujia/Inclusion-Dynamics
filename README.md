# Inclusion Dynamics: Physics from the Impossibility of Nothing

> "Nothing never was — the universe is the dynamics of being."

**Inclusion Dynamics** is a first-principles framework for physics built on the Principle of Non-Null Ontology (PNO): the axiom that absolute non-existence is impossible. From this necessity, we derive a conserved scalar field Φ representing the density of existence and a state-dependent transport function C(Φ) governing its flow. Spacetime curvature, gauge interactions, quantum behavior, and the Standard Model all emerge as effective phenomena of this deeper substrate.
